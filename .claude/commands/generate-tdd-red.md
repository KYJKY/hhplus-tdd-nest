Write tests that will initially fail.

Guidelines:
- Clearly define the requirements of the feature to be implemented
- Name test cases to describe the functionality
- Use the Given–When–Then pattern
- Include edge cases and exceptional scenarios
- Write tests that invoke functions/methods that are not yet implemented

Write only the tests; do not write any implementation code.
