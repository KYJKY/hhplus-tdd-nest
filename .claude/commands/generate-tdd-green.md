Write the minimal code required to make the failing tests pass.

Guidelines:
- Choose the simplest and clearest implementation
- Focus on working code over code quality
- All tests must pass
- Hardcoding is allowed (weâ€™ll improve later)
- After implementation, provide instructions on how to run the tests
